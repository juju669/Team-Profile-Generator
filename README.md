An Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Demonstration

DESCRIPTION:

build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, youâ€™ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Installation & Operation:
run npm install to install required dependencies
run node index.js to start the application
enter the information that the application requests
upon completion open the index.html file in the bowser to view your results
